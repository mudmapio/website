## Mudmap is a passion project for time poor engineers and service providers

I never set out to make Mudmap a revolutionary product. I made it to make life
a little easier and free up time for other things. It is the brainchild of
many hours toiling away in SSH tunnels or OpenVPN connections only to make a
small change, or conduct an audit. I wanted a central point of reference, to
stop wasting my precious time, and I wanted to give you that freedom, too.

There is no board of directors, marketing team, or anyone else. It's just me,
working to make this product better every day. If you email, or raise a support
ticket you will get a direct response from me - someone who is intimately aware
of how the system works and wants you to succeed.

I try to be transparent about what this product is and isn't whilst providing
rock-solid service. I do this by publishing updates, maintaining a presence on
social media and listening to your requests, and gripes. If there is a process
or a feature that I can implement to make your job more efficient, reach out
and email me at dan@mudmap.io. I really do want to hear from you.

I am currently based in [Canberra][location], Australia and when I am not working on this
site, I will be with my family, playing sport or trying out some new hobby. I
am also an avid [Hockey] fan.
