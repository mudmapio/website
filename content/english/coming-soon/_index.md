### Thanks for your interest

What a priviledge to have you here. Unfortunately, I have decided to delay the
launch of Mudmap for the time being. When the security and basic functionality
is ready the Dashboard will go live. Expected launch will be April 2021.

If you are interested in joining then subscribe the newsletter below to receive
updates about the service, it's offerings and when it is open for public use.

If you are keen on being a beta test (free, of course) then please [email] and
we can get you setup.

Check out the [Roadmap], and if you have any feature requests, feel free to add
one to [github][feature], or [email] me directly

Look forward to making Mudmap a great tool in your arsenal.
