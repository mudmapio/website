## You've probably got some of these problems

As a managed service provider (MSP) do you deal with any of these? IT service
providers are

- Have tens or hundreds of pfSense devices across several clients
- Needed to update one or several devices meaning you then had to login via SSH
  or a VPN, navigate the user interface, make the change, and then repeat that
  over and over again.
- Deliberately not used pfSense simply because it lacks unified management -
  even though it's the right tool for your customers

I designed Mudmap to stop this needless waste of time, resources and brain
drain.

### Manage multiple devices in one location

Mudmap is a single pane of glass that lets you connect your devices and view
them in one location. It also allows you to manage them, not just view. Need to
update a firewall rule, add an alias or delete a DNS server? Mudmap has you
covered.

### Remove the need to SSH in all the time

Instead of SSH'ing in or making a VPN connection, only to then have to login to
the user interface, navigate to the item you need and then logout once done,
let Mudmap do that for you.

Once Mudmap has made its initial connection to the device, it can SSH to it and
make changes via its API as the service account user.

Using the API is faster, and leaves an audit trail. It uses a layered security
approach with SSH as its transport layer and API authentication before polling
the device for any information.

### Don't let the lack of a native pfSense management platform hold you back

Now that you can use a platform like Mudmap, it is possible to roll out pfSense
to your customers and be able to provide remote management.

The cost of Mudmap is easily offset against such a feature - allowing your
customers piece of mind that you can continue to support their business
operations and network security.

### Mudmap is tailored to MSP's by providing:

- Remote network management, including updating firewall rules, alias', DNS
  records, and more
- Service stop, restart and start functionality without logging in
- Decreased audit times through the single pane of glass overview of each
  device
- Remote configuration backup's with one click
- The ability to update devices individually, or in bulk without logging in to
  each one

Put simply, Mudmap is the ideal solution for managing multiple firewalls across
many customers.
