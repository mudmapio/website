## Management should not mean endless SSH tunnels or VPN connections

A real problem with pfSense and other open source firewalls is the lack of
unified management. This means administrators are often waiting for their SSH
tunnels or VPN connections to establish before even gaining access to the
device.

This says nothing to the monotony that is clicking through all the tabs and
panes to actually make the change. Compound this over a number of devices and
it could mean an entire days work just to update some rules or upgrade a
package.

### Mudmap unifies your devices

After connecting your device to Mudmap, you no longer need to log in to that
device individually. It will display all the relevant information pertaining
that device, similar to pfSense's current user interface. You can also make
changes, restart services or even reboot the device. Once back online, Mudmap
will connect with it again, without any action on your part.

Things Mudmap lets you do without logging into each device manually:

- View system information
- Stop, start and restart system services
- View and update DNS records, VLAN and Interface's
- Download latest configuration files for backup
- View, update and delete firewall rules
- Update firewall alias'
- View state and table data
- Configure traffic shaping

Knowing that you can do all these tasks from one location, without the monotony
of individual logins, why waste anymore time?

Start today and see the difference it makes.
